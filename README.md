## Getting Started

### Installation

This gem can be installed directly:

```bash
$ gem install auth0
```

or with [Bundler](https://bundler.io/man/bundle-add.1.html):

```bash
bundle add auth0
```

### Usage

Create an instance of `Auth0Client` to access properties and methods of the authentication and management APIs:

```ruby
require 'auth0'

client = Auth0Client.new(
  client_id: ENV['AUTH0_RUBY_CLIENT_ID'],
  client_secret: ENV['AUTH0_RUBY_CLIENT_SECRET'],
  domain: ENV['AUTH0_RUBY_DOMAIN'],
  # If you pass in a client_secret value, the SDK will automatically try to get a
  # Management API token for this application. Make sure your Application can make a
  # Client Credentials grant (Application settings in Auth0 > Advanced > Grant Types
  # tab) and that the Application is authorized for the Management API:
  # https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/config/using-the-auth0-dashboard
  #
  # Otherwise, you can pass in a Management API token directly for testing or temporary
  # access using the key below.
  # token: ENV['AUTH0_RUBY_API_TOKEN'],
  #
  # When passing a token, you can also specify when the token expires in seconds from epoch. Otherwise, expiry is set
  # by default to an hour from now.
  # token_expires_at: Time.now.to_i + 86400
)
```

If `token` is omitted, the SDK will attempt to fetch a new token using the `client_credentials` grant, provided that `client_id` and `client_secret` are provided in the configuration. Once the token is about to expire (or has already expired), a new token will be fetched and cached for future calls.

For this to work, ensure your application can make a Client Credentials grant (Application settings in Auth0 > Advanced > Grant Types tab) and that the application is authorized for the Management API: https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/config/using-the-auth0-dashboard

## Authentication API Client

This SDK provides access to [Authentication API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication) endpoints with the `Auth0::API::AuthenticationEndpoints` module.

For basic login capability, we suggest using our OmniAuth stategy [detailed here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/rails/01-login). Other authentication tasks currently supported are:

- Register a new user with a database connection using the `signup` method.
- Redirect a user to the universal login page for authentication using the `authorization_url` method.
- Log a user into a highly trusted app with the [Resource Owner Password grant](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/tutorials/password-grant) using the `login` method.
- Exchange an authorization code for an access token on callback using the `obtain_user_tokens` method (see the note on state validation below).
- Send a change password email to a database connection user using the `change_password` method.
- Log a user out of Auth0 with the `logout_url` method.

**Important note on state validation**: If you choose to implement a login flow callback yourself, it is important to generate and store a `state` value, pass that value to Auth0 in the `authorization_url` method, and validate it in your callback URL before calling `obtain_user_tokens`. For more information on state validation, [please see our documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/oauth2/oauth-state).

Please note that this module implements endpoints that might be deprecated for newer tenants. If you have any questions about how and when the endpoints should be used, consult the [documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication) or ask in our [Community forums](https://community.auth0.com/tags/wordpress).

## Management API Client

This SDK provides access to the [Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2) via modules that help create clear and accurate calls. Most of the interaction is done through the `Auth0Client` class, instantiated with the required credentials.

For an example of using the management API client to read of users, see the [examples document](https://github.com/auth0/ruby-auth0/blob/master/EXAMPLES.md).
