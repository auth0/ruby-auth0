### TODO: Replace instances of './.github/workflow/' w/ `auth0/dx-sdk-actions/` and append `@latest` after the common `dx-sdk-actions` repo is made public.
### TODO: Also remove `get-prerelease`, `get-version`, `rubygems-publish`, `release-create`, `tag-create` and `tag-exists` actions from this repo's .github/actions folder and `ruby-release` from `./github/workflows` once the repo is public.
